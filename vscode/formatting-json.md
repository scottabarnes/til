# Keyboard shortcuts for formatting JSON in vscode

Learnt two useful shortcuts for formatting JSON in vscode today. The first was from the [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json) - a JSON document can be formatted using `Shift+Alt+F` (looks like this should work for other file types too). The next was from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30067767/how-do-i-collapse-sections-of-code-in-visual-studio-code-for-windows) where I got the keyboard shortcuts of `Shift+Alt+[` to expand and `Shift+Alt+]` to collapse regions.
