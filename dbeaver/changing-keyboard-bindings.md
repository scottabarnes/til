# Changing keyboard bindings in dbeaver

I needed to change the keyboard shortcut for collapse / expand code blocks, as the default in dbeaver relies on `NumPad_Subtract` which I do not have access to on my keyboard.

I was able to adjust this from the settings menu, found from File->Preference->Interface->Keys.
